ANSYS - TRUE SIMULATION PLATFORM 
======
So they say.
* ANSYS Fluent -> For CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Simulation
* Where ANSYS Student is absolutely free.

**TYPES OF PROGRAMS**
----

* ROCKY -> For simulation of bulk object, either solid or liquid (Particle Simulation)
* MarkForged -> 3D Printer Line Ups

**ANSYS itself has many applications, those being;**
---
* Aerospace / Defense
* High Tech Electronics
* Healthcare and Biomedical Industries

We shall focus on the Healthcare part
* 80% of the top 50 healthcare companies used ANSYS, Johnson-Johnson, Moderna. (fuck China and your Sinovac bullshit)

By which these healthcare companies would simulate the Simulation Flight for the on-going COVID-19, which includes;
* Fitting the Facial Mask Properly
* General Flight Path of Airborne COVID-19 specimen
* Static Air Simulation of COVID-19 particles when sneezing
